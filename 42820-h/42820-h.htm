<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>POLITICAL PREDICTIONS.</h3>

  <p>It would be interesting, and perhaps not wholly unprofitable, to bring
  together the various attempts that have been made to shadow forth the
  approaching crisis in the political world. As literary curiosities, such
  things may be worth preserving; and I therefore send you a few samples as
  a contribution.</p>

  <p>The first is from the Abbé De la Mennais, whose words, uttered about
  twenty years ago, are thus given in a provincial paper:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"England, like all other countries, has had her period of
  aggrandisement; during a whole century Europe has seen her dawning above
  the horizon until, having attained her highest degree of splendour, she
  has begun to decline, and this decline dates from the day of which the
  fall of Napoleon, due principally to her exertions, marked the most
  brilliant period of her glory. Since that time her policy has undergone a
  striking change, which every year becomes more evident. Instead of that
  vigour and promptitude of resolution of which she used to give so many
  proofs (though they could not all be praised alike, because there were
  more than one act repugnant to morality), she is now timid, she
  hesitates, she labours painfully through the dark and crooked paths of
  diplomacy, and substitutes intrigue for action; incapable, it would seem,
  of taking a decisive part at the right moment, even on the most momentous
  occasions. The English nation has evidently lost its strength, or the
  belief in its strength; and as to actual results, one differs not from
  the other. Look at this England, so haughty, so wedded to her interests,
  so skilful formerly in defending them, so bold in extending their
  influence over the whole world; look at her now in the presence of
  Russia. Humbled, braved by that young power, one would say that she
  trembles before its genius. The Czars exercise over her a species of
  fascination which disturbs her councils and relaxes the muscles of her
  robust arms. The conquests of the Russians in the East menace the
  possessions of England in India; they close the Dardanelles to her
  fleets, they shut out her commerce from the mouths of the Danube and the
  shores of the Black Sea. After what fashion would she have resisted these
  things thirty years ago?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The next quotation is from Alison's <i>History of Europe from the Fall
  of Napoleon</i>, published in 1852. In chap. i. p. 68., after citing some
  lines from Gray on <i>Education and Government</i>, he thus proceeds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It will be so to the end of the world; for in the north, and there
  alone, are found the privations which insure hardihood, the poverty which
  impels to conquest, the difficulties which rouse to exertion.
  Irresistible to men so actuated is the attraction which the climate of
  the south, the riches of civilisation, exercise on the poverty and energy
  of the native wilds. Slowly but steadily, for two centuries, the
  Muscovite power has increased, devouring everything which it
  approaches&mdash;ever advancing, never receding. Sixty-six millions of
  men, doubling every half century, now obey the mandates of the Czar;
  whose will is law, and who leads a people whose passion is conquest.
  Europe may well tremble at the growth of a power possessed of such
  resources, actuated by such desires, led by such ability; but Europe
  alone does not comprise the whole family of mankind. The great designs of
  Providence are working out their accomplishment by the passions of the
  free agents to which their execution has been intrusted. Turkey will
  yield, Persia be overrun by Muscovite battalions; the original
  birth-place of our religion will be rescued by their devotion; and as
  certainly as the Transatlantic hemisphere, and the islands of the Indian
  Sea, will be peopled by the self-acting passions of Western democracy,
  will the plains of Asia be won to the Cross by the resistless arms of
  Eastern despotism."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I shall conclude with two or three extracts from a pamphlet, published
  some time last year at Toronto, and bearing the significant title, <i>The
  coming Struggle among the Nations of the Earth; or the Political Events
  of the next Fifteen Years, &amp;c.</i> The writer begins by interpreting,
  as applicable to the present times, the prophecies of Ezekiel, Daniel,
  and the Apocalypse, from which he foretells the following events:</p>

  <p>1. The seizure of Constantinople, and overthrow of Turkey by the
  Emperor of Russia.</p>

  <p>2. War between France and Austria: overthrow of the latter, and
  consequent destruction of the Papacy.</p>

  <p>3. The conquest of the Horns or Continental Powers by the Emperor of
  Russia.</p>

  <p>4. Britain rapidly extends her Eastern possessions, prevents the
  occupation of Judea, and completes the first stage of the restoration of
  the Jews.</p>

  <p>The writer then continues in the following strain:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Turning his eyes eastward on the wealth and prosperity of the
  countries under British protection, the triumphant conqueror of Europe
  will conceive the idea of spoiling them, and appropriating their goods
  and cattle. Scarcely is this idea formed, than its execution is begun;
  and sudden and terrific as a whirlwind he enters the 'glorious land.' So
  sudden and unexpected is his onslaught, that the British power is
  unprepared, and Egypt, Ethiopia, and Libya fall into his hands.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile, Britain has been making strenuous efforts to stop the
  progress of this gigantic Napoleon; and every soldier that can be spared
  is sent away in the direction of the rising sun. But what can the British
  army do against such a host as the Russian autocrat has around him? Brave
  as the officers and men may be, what success or what renown can be gained
  in such an unequal conflict? In the critical emergency, the parent island
  sends a cry across the Atlantic, 'Come over and help us!' Swiftly is the
  sound borne over the waves, and soon an answering <!-- Page 560 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="560.png"><a name="page560"></a>{560}</span>echo is
  wafted back from the shores of Columbia. The cause is common, and the
  struggle must be common too. 'We are coming, brother John, we are
  coming,' is the noble reply; and, almost ere it is delivered, a fleet of
  gallant vessels is crossing the Pacific, with the stars and stripes
  gleaming on every mast. Another force is on its way from the far south,
  and soon the flower and strength of Anglo-Saxon race meet on the sacred
  soil of Palestine. The intelligence of their approach reaches the
  sacrilegious usurper, and he leads forth his army towards the mountains
  that rise in glory round about Jerusalem. The Jews within the city now
  arm themselves, and join the army that has come from the east and west,
  the north and south, for their protection: and thus these two mighty
  masses meet face to face, and prepare for the greatest <i>physical</i>
  battle that ever was fought on this struggling earth. On the one side the
  motley millions of Russia, and the nations of Continental Europe, are
  drawn up on the slopes of the hills, and the sides of the valleys toward
  the north; while, on the other, are ranged the thousands of Britain and
  her offspring; from whose firm and regular ranks gleam forth the dark
  eyes of many of the sons of Abraham, determined to preserve their newly
  recovered city or perish, like their ancestors of a former age, in its
  ruins.</p>

  <p>"All is ready. That awful pause, which takes place before the shock of
  battle, reigns around; but ere it is broken by the clash of meeting arms,
  and while yet the contending parties are at a little distance from each
  other, a strange sound is heard over head. The time for the visible
  manifestation of God's vengeance has arrived, his fury has come up in his
  face, and He calls for a sword against Gog throughout all the mountains.
  'Tis this voice of the Lord that breaks the solemn stillness, and
  startles the assembled hosts. The scene that follows baffles description.
  Amid earthquakes and showers of fire, the bewildered and maddened armies
  of the autocrat rush, sword in hand, against each other, while the
  Israelites and their Anglo-Saxon friends gaze on the spectacle with
  amazement and consternation. It does not appear that they will even lift
  their hand against that foe which they had come so far to meet. Their aid
  is not necessary to accomplish the destruction of the image. The stone,
  cut without hands, shall fall on its feet and break them to pieces; and
  then shall the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,
  become like the chaff of the summer threshing-floor, and the wind shall
  carry them away. The various descriptions which we have of this battle,
  all intimate that God is the only foe that shall contend with the
  autocrat at Armageddon. John terms it, 'the battle of that great day of
  God Almighty;' and we believe the principal instrument of their defeat
  will be mutual slaughter. The carnage will be dreadful. Out of all the
  millions that came like a cloud upon the land of Israel, only a scattered
  and shattered remnant will return; the great mass will be left to
  'cleanse the land,' and fill the valley of Hamongog with graves."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I refrain from quoting the remarks made by Napoleon, at St. Helena,
  respecting Russia, and the likelihood of her ultimately subjugating
  Western Europe, as your readers must be familiar with them from the
  writings of O'Meara and others.</p>

<h3>DERIVATION OF THE WORD "BIGOT."</h3>

  <p>At p. 80. of Mr. Trench's admirable little volume <i>On the Study of
  Words</i>, an etymology is assigned to the word <i>bigot</i>, which is, I
  think, clearly erroneous:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Two explanations of it are current," writes Mr. Trench, "one of which
  traces it up to the early Normans, while they yet retained their northern
  tongue, and to their often adjuration by the name of God; with sometimes
  a reference to a famous scene in French history, in which Rollo, Duke of
  Normandy, played a conspicuous part: the other puts it in connexion with
  <i>beguines</i>, called often in Latin <i>beguttæ</i>, a name by which
  certain communities of pietist women were known in the Middle Ages."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I agree with Mr. Trench in thinking, that neither of these derivations
  is the correct one. But I am obliged, quite as decidedly, to reject that
  which he proceeds to offer. He thinks that we owe&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Bigot</i> rather to that profound impression which the Spaniards
  made upon all Europe in the fifteenth and the following century. Now the
  word <i>bigote</i>," he continues, "means in Spanish 'moustachio;' and as
  contrasted with the smooth, or nearly smooth, upper lip of most other
  people, at that time the Spaniards were the 'men of the moustachio'....
  That they themselves connected firmness and resolution with the
  mustachio; that it was esteemed the outward symbol of these, it is plain
  from such phrases as 'pombre de bigote,' a man of resolution; 'tener
  bigotes,' to stand firm. But that in which they eminently displayed their
  firmness and resolution in those days was their adherence to whatever the
  Roman see imposed and taught. What then more natural, or more entirely
  according to the law of the generation of names, than that this striking
  and distinguishing outward feature of the Spaniard should have been laid
  hold of to express that character and condition of mind which eminently
  were his, and then transferred to all others who shared the same?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Of this it must be admitted, that "se non e vero, e ben trovato." And
  the only reason for rejecting such an etymology is the existence of
  another with superior claims.</p>

  <p><i>Bigot</i> is derived, as I think will be hardly doubted on
  consideration, from the Italian <i>bigio</i>, grey. Various religious
  confraternities, and especially a branch of the order of St. Francis
  which, from being parcel secular and parcel regular, was called "Terziari
  di S. Francesco," clothed themselves in grey; and from thence were called
  <i>Bigiocchi</i> and <i>Bigiotti</i>. And from a very early period, the
  word was used in a bad sense. <!-- Page 561 --><span class="pagenum" title="561.png"
  ><a name="page561"></a>{561}</span></p>

  <p>Menage, in his <i>Origini della Lingua Italiana</i>, under the word
  <span class="sc">Bizoco</span>, writes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Persono secolare vestita di abito di religione. Quasi 'bigioco'
  perche ordinariamente gli Ipocriti, e coloro che si fanno dell' ordine di
  S. Francesco si vestono di bigio."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And Sansovino on the <i>Decameron</i> says that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Bizocco</i> sia quasi <i>Bigioco</i>, o <i>Bigiotto</i>, perchè i
  Terziari di S. Francesco si veston di bigio."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Abundance of instances might be adduced of the use of the term
  <i>bizocco</i> in the sense of hypocrite, or would-be saint. And the
  passage which Mr. Trench gives after Richardson from Bishop Hall, where
  <i>bigot</i> is used to signify a pervert to Romanism, "he was turned
  both <i>bigot</i> and physician," seems to me to favour my etymology
  rather than that from the Spanish; as showing that the earliest known use
  of the term was its application to a Popish religionist. The "pervert"
  alluded to had become that which cotemporary Italians were calling a
  <i>bigiotto</i>. Must we not conclude that Bishop Hall drew his
  newly-coined word thence?</p>

<h3>"BOOK OF ALMANACS."</h3>

  <p>When I published this work, I knew of no predecessor except
  Franc&oelig;ur, as noted in the preface; but another has been recently
  pointed out to me. There was a work compiled for the use of the
  Dominicans, entitled <i>Kalendarium Perpetuum juxta ritum Sacri ordinis
  prædicatorum, s. p. n. Dominici</i>. The copy now before me, Rome, 1612,
  8vo., is said to be "tertio emendatum," which probably signifies the
  fourth edition. It contains the thirty-five almanacs, with rules for
  determining epacts and dominical letters from <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 1600 to 2100, and a table for choosing the almanac
  when the epact and letter are known.</p>

  <p>This work must have been compiled before the reformation of the
  calendar. A note in explanation of the thirty-fifth almanac, contains the
  statement that <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1736 belongs to that
  calendar, and to the letters D.C. This is true of the old style, and not
  of the new.</p>

  <p>It seems, then, that <i>Books of Almanacs</i> are older than the
  Gregorian reformation: that they may have been completely forgotten, may
  be inferred from my book never having produced any mention of them either
  in your pages or elsewhere. Perhaps some older instances may be yet
  produced.</p>

  <p><i>Distances at which Sounds have been heard.</i>&mdash;The story of
  St. Paul's clock striking being heard by a sentry at Windsor is well
  known, and I believe authentic. Let me add the following:&mdash;The Rev.
  Hugh Salvin (who died vicar of Alston, Cumberland, Sept. 28, 1852)
  mentions an equally remarkable instance whilst he was chaplain on board
  H.M.S. "Cambridge," on the coast of South America:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Our salutes at Chancay were heard at Callao, though the distance is
  thirty-five miles, and several projecting headlands intervene, and the
  wind always blows northward. The lieutenant of the Arab store-ship, to
  whom the circumstance was mentioned, observed, that upon one occasion the
  evening gun at Plymouth was heard at Ilfracomb, which is sixty miles off,
  and a mountainous country intervenes."&mdash;<i>Journal of the Rev. H. S.

  <p><i>Anagram.</i>&mdash;The accompanying anagram I saw, some weeks back,
  in a country paper; perhaps you will give it a local habitation in "N.
  &amp; Q." It is said to be by a president of one of the committees of the
  arrondissement of Valenciennes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A sa majesté impériale Le Szar Nicholas, souverain et autocrate de
  toutes les Russies."</p>

  <p>"Oho! ta vanité sera ta perte; elle isole la Russie; tes successeurs
  te maudiront à jamais."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Philip Strange.</span></p>

  <p><i>Logan or Rocking Stones.</i>&mdash;The following extract from Sir
  C. Anderson's <i>Eight Weeks' Journal in Norway, &amp;c. in 1852</i>,
  under July 21, may interest your Devonshire and Cornish readers:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mr. De C&mdash;&mdash;k, a most intelligent Danish gentleman, told
  me, that when a proprietor near Drammen, was at Bjornholm Island, in the
  Baltic, he was told there were stones which made a humming noise when
  pushed, and on examination they proved to be rocking-stones; on his
  return, he found on his own property several large stones, which, on
  removing the earth around them, were so balanced as to be moveable. If
  this be an accurate statement, it tends to strengthen the notion that
  stones, laid upon each other by natural causes, have, by application of a
  little labour, been made to move, as the stones at Brimham Craggs in
  Yorkshire; and this seems more likely than that such immense masses
  should have been ever raised by mechanical force and poised."</p>

<h3>A RUBENS QUERY.</h3>

  <p>There is a somewhat curious mystery with regard to certain works of
  the immortal Rubens, which some of your readers, who are connoisseurs in
  art, may possibly assist to dispel. Lommeline, who engraved the finest
  works of Rubens, has left a print of "The Judgment of Paris," which <!--
  Page 562 --><span class="pagenum" title="562.png"><a
  name="page562"></a>{562}</span>differs in several points from the subject
  of "The Decision of Paris," now in the National Gallery. For instance, in
  the one, Paris rests the apple upon his knee, and in the other he is
  offering it to the fair goddess of Beauty. This print has also
  <i>five</i> more figures than there are in the Gallery painting. Now, two
  questions arise hereon: first, what has become of the original painting
  from which this print was taken? and secondly, where is the line
  engraving of the picture now in the National Gallery?</p>

<h3>THE PAXS PENNIES OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.</h3>

  <p>Perhaps some of your numerous readers may be able to satisfy me on a
  subject which has for a long time troubled me.</p>

  <p>All coin collectors are aware that there are many different reverses
  to the pennies of William I. One is commonly called the <i>pax</i><span
  class="nw">-type:</span> and <i>why</i>, is the question.</p>

  <p>On the obverse, it is "<span class="sm">PILLM REX</span>," or
  sometimes differently spelt; but "<span class="sm">P</span>" always
  stands for "<span class="sm">W</span>," and pronounced so.</p>

  <p>On the reverse, it is <span class="sc">P &#x100; X S</span> (each
  letter being encircled), but the "<span class="sm">P</span>" is here
  pronounced "<span class="sm">P</span>;" this is in the centre
  compartment: surrounding it is the moneyer's name, with place where the
  coin was struck&mdash;"<span class="sm">EDPI</span> (Edwi) <span
  class="sm">ON LVND</span>," "<span class="sm">GODPINE</span> (Godwine)
  <span class="sm">ON LVND</span>," &amp;c. It is very inconsistent that
  letters should be pronounced differently on the same coin.</p>

  <p>I am rather of opinion that we have not arrived at the right reading,
  and that <i>pax</i> has nothing to do with it. It is <span
  class="sm">PAXS</span>, <span class="sm">AXSP</span>, <span
  class="sm">XSPA</span>, or <span class="sm">SPAX</span>: for I find, on
  comparing nineteen different coins, the letters stand in different
  positions compared with the cross, which denotes the beginning of the
  inscription around them; so no one can tell which letter of the four in
  the circles near the large cross should come first. Besides, what does
  the "<span class="sm">S</span>" stand for, after you get the "<span
  class="sm">PAX</span>?"</p>

  <p>I am not a member of the Antiquarian Society, but have asked gentlemen
  belonging to it to explain this puzzle (to me), without success. I now
  ask them and others, through your pages, to give a solution of the
  difficulty.</p>

  years 1648 and 1666. In some of these he is described as printer to the
  University of Cambridge, in others as 'One of His Highness's Printers;'
  but in those which <i>tradition</i> says were published for the army, he
  is called 'Printer to the Parliament.' They are all as correctly printed
  as Bibles were generally published during that time, excepting that by
  Giles Calvert the Quaker, published in 1653, which is singularly correct
  and beautiful. Field's editions being remarkable for beauty of typography
  and smallness, have been much examined, and many errors detected. That of
  1653 is the most beautiful and called genuine, and is the copy said to
  have been printed for the use of the army and navy. Of this I have five
  different editions, all agreeing in the error in Matthew, ch. vi. v. 24.,
  'Ye cannot serve and mammon;' and in having the first four psalms on one
  page. But in some the following errors are corrected, 1 Cor. vi. v. 9.,
  'The unrighteous shall inherit the kingdom of God;' Rom. ch. vi. v. 13.,
  'Neither yield ye your members as instruments of righteousness unto sin.'
  The copy of 1658, which <span class="sc">Sir. W. C. Trevelyan</span>
  describes, is a counterfeit of the genuine edition of 1653, vulgarly
  called 'The Bastard Field's Bible.' These were reprinted many times. I
  possess four different editions of it, so exactly alike in form and
  appearance, that the variations throughout can only be detected by
  placing them in juxtaposition. They are all neatly printed, without a
  black line between the columns, and make thicker volumes than the genuine
  edition. I have never been able to verify the tradition that the Field's
  Bible, 1653, was printed for the army by order of Cromwell. It is the
  only one, as far as I can discover, 'Printed by John Field, Printer to
  the Parliament.' I received the tradition from my father nearly sixty
  years ago, and have no doubt but that it is founded in fact. It is an
  inquiry well worthy of investigation.&mdash;<span class="sc">G.

  Kincaid in 1766; after which there followed editions very coarsely and
  incorrectly printed. They are all, excepting that of 1647, in my

  bound in green morocco, cost me five shillings. That of 1747, by Watkins,

  <p><i>Dryden and Luke Milbourne.</i>&mdash;Among the "Quarrels of

  Pattern</i>, by the latter (8vo., 1697), he shows unmistakeable evidence
  of having been lately skinned by the <i>witty tribe</i>, which I take to
  mean Dryden and his <i>atheistical crew</i>. I am aware that Milbourne
  invited the attack by his flippant remarks upon the English Virgil, but I
  know not in which piece of Dryden's to look for it.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Dryden's attack on Milbourne occurs in his preface to the Fables
  (Scott's edition of his <i>Works</i>, vol. xi. p. 235.). "As a corollary
  to this preface," says Dryden, "in which I have done justice to others, I
  owe somewhat to myself; not that I think it worth my time to enter the
  lists with one Milbourne and one Blackmore, but barely to take notice
  that such men there are, who have written scurrilously against me without
  any provocation. Milbourne, who is in orders, pretends, amongst the rest,
  this quarrel to me, that I have fallen foul on priesthood; if I have, I
  am only to ask pardon of good priests, and am afraid his part of the
  reparation will come to little. Let him be satisfied that he shall not be
  able to force himself upon me for an adversary. I contemn him too much to
  enter into competition with him." A little lower down Dryden hints that
  Milbourne lost his living for writing a libel upon his parishioners.]</p>

<h3>NORWICH, KIRKPATRICK COLLECTION MSS. FOR THE HISTORY OF.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 515.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent T. A. T. can find a full, but in one respect a most
  unsatisfactory reply to his inquiry, in the preface to a <i>History of
  the Religious Orders and Communities, and of the Hospital and Castle of
  Norwich</i>, by Mr. John Kirkpatrick, Treasurer of the Great Hospital,
  bearing the names of Edwards and Hughes, London, and Stevenson and
  Hatchett, Norwich, as publishers, and dated 1845. This volume was printed
  at the expense of Hudson Gurney, Esq., whose "well-known liberality and
  laudable desire to perpetuate the knowledge of the antiquities of his
  native city," the preface fitly records; but it was not, in the
  commercial sense of the word, <i>published</i>; and, therefore, the
  information it gives may not be generally accessible. The following is
  the list of the collections which were "safe in the custody of the
  corporation about thirty years ago (say between 1800 and 1810), when M.
  de Hague held the office of town-clerk."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1. A thick volume of the early history and jurisdiction of the city;
  date 1720.</p>

  <p>2. A similar folio volume, being an account of the military state of
  the city, its walls, towns, ponds, pits, wells, pumps, &amp;c.; date
  1722.</p>

  <p>3. A thick quarto.</p>

  <p>4. Several large bundles, foolscap folio; Annals of Norwich.</p>

  <p>5. A fasciculus, foolscap folio; origin of charities and wills
  relating thereto, in each parish.</p>

  <p>6. Memorandum books of monuments.</p>

  <p>7. Ditto of merchants' marks.</p>

  <p>8. Ditto of plans of churches.</p>

  <p>9. Paper containing drawings of the city gates, and a plan of
  Norwich.</p>

  <p>10. Drawings of all the churches.</p>

  <p>11. An immense number of small pieces of paper, containing notes of
  the tenures of each house in Norwich."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>No portion of these collections remains at present in the hands of the
  legatees, and the greater number of them is not so much as known to be in
  existence. The "thick quarto," marked "3" in the list, is that which Mr.
  Gurney's zeal has caused to be printed; and it is now the property of the
  representatives of the late Mr. William Herring of Hethersett, whose
  father purchased it many years ago of a bookseller. The paper marked "9"
  was "said to have been in the possession of the Friars' Society," which
  was discovered some twenty years ago. My father had tracings of the
  "Drawings of the City Gates;" but I am not sure that they are made from
  Kirkpatrick's original. The collection marked "10," my father saw "in the
  possession of Mr. William Matthews, Mr. De Hague's clerk." And "a portion
  of the papers included under the last number" was said to be existence in
  1845; but Mr. Dawson Turner, who compiled the "Preface," was "not fully
  informed" respecting them, and I can throw no light upon the subject. It
  is very remarkable that the Norfolk and Norwich Archæological Association
  has done nothing for the recovery or <i>dis</i>covery of the remainder of
  this invaluable bequest; perhaps the inquiry of T. A. T. may incite them
  to attempt both, and in this hope I trouble you with this reply.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">B. B. Woodward.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Bungay, Suffolk.</p>

  <p>In the year 1845, one of the MSS. of Mr. John Kirkpatrick was printed
  at Yarmouth, edited by Mr. Dawson Turner, at the expense of Mr. Hudson
  Gurney. This MS. is the <i>History of the Religious Orders and
  Communities, and of the Hospital and Castle of Norwich</i>, and filled a
  quarto of 258 folios in the handwriting of the author. In a very
  interesting preface, the editor states that no portion of Kirkpatrick's
  bequest remains at present in the hands of the corporation of Norwich, or
  is even known to be in existence, except the volume thus edited, and
  perhaps some fragments of the "small pieces of paper," described in the
  will as "containing notes of the tenure of each house in Norwich," which,
  if such do exist, are, it is to be feared, so scattered and injured as to
  be useless. The editor enumerates and describes eleven MSS. which, he
  says, were safe in the custody of the corporation about forty years ago
  from the present time: but, he adds, they have now disappeared, with the
  exception of the volume which he has edited. This MS. is the property of
  the representatives of the late Mr. William Herring, of Hethersett, whose
  father purchased it of a bookseller.</p>

  <p>The series of plates extends to fifteen, among which are those

  transcription necessary on mounting them. Each represents, figuratively,
  one of the steps towards the philosopher's stone. Some have Latin
  explanations at the foot. Not understanding alchemy, I can appreciate
  them only as works of art. An account of one as a specimen may be of some

<h3>THE BELLMAN AT NEWGATE.</h3>

485.: and see <i>Continental Watchmen</i>, Vol. iv.,
pp. 206. 356.)</p>

  <p>Formerly it was, according to a very ancient custom, the practice on
  the night preceding the execution of condemned criminals, for the bellman
  of the parish of St. Sepulchre to go under Newgate, and, ringing his
  bell, to repeat the following verses, as a piece of friendly advice, to
  the unhappy wretches under sentence of death:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"All you that in the condemn'd hold do lie,</p>
      <p>Prepare you, for to-morrow you shall die.</p>
      <p>Watch all and pray, the hour is drawing near,</p>
      <p>That you before the Almighty must appear.</p>
      <p>Examine well yourselves, in time repent,</p>
      <p>That you may not to eternal flames be sent.</p>
      <p>And when St. Sepulchre's bell to-morrow tolls,</p>
      <p>The Lord have mercy on your souls!</p>
      <p class="i3">Past twelve o'clock!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The following extract from Stowe's <i>Survey of London</i>, p. 125. of
  the quarto edition, printed 1618, will prove that the above verses ought
  to be repeated by a clergyman instead of a bellman:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Robert Doue, citizen and merchant taylor, of London, gave to the
  parish of St. Sepulchre's the sum of 50<i>l.</i> That after the several
  sessions of London, when the prisoners remain in the gaole, as condemned
  men to death, expecting execution on the morrow following; the clarke
  (that is the parson) of the church shoold come in the night time, and
  likewise early in the morning, to the window of the prison where they
  lye, and there ringing certain tolls with a hand-bell appointed for the
  purpose, he doth afterwards (in most Christian manner) put them in mind
  of their present condition, and ensuing execution, desiring them to be
  prepared therefore, as they ought to be. When they are in the cart, and
  brought before the wall of the church, there he standeth ready with the
  same bell. And after certain tolls rehearseth an appointed prayer,
  desiring all the people there present to pray for them. The beadle also
  of Merchant Taylors' Hall hath an honest stipend allowed to see that it
  is duely done."</p>

<h3>HERBERT'S "CHURCH PORCH."</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 173.)</p>

  <p>I venture the following as the meaning of the curious stanza in George
  Herbert's <i>Church Porch</i>, referred to by your correspondent <span
  class="sc">S. Singleton</span>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"God made me one man; love makes me no more,</p>
      <p>Till labor come and make my weakness score."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>If you are single, give all you have to the service of God. But do not
  be anxious to make the gift larger by toil: for God only requires that
  which is suitable to the position in which He has placed you. He bestows
  a certain "estate" upon every man as He bestows life: let both be
  dedicated to Him. For if you give first yourself, and then what He has
  given you, this is sufficient; you need not try to be more rich, that you
  may be more charitable. But if you choose a life of labour to gain an
  "estate" beyond the original position assigned to you in the providence
  of God, then you must reckon yourself responsible for the "one man" which
  God "made" you, and for <i>the other</i> which you make yourself
  besides.</p>

  <p>I conceive the stanza to be a recommendation of the contemplative life
  with poverty, in preference to the active life with riches.</p>

<h3>ANCIENT USAGES OF THE CHURCH.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., pp. 127. 257.)</p>

  <p>As your well-known correspondent from Clyst St. George has addressed
  an inquiry to you on this subject, it may not be uninteresting to some of
  your readers to learn that the practice of kneeling at funerals still
  exists in this neighbourhood. On a cold December day have I seen men,
  women, and children bend the knee on the bare sod, during the Lord's and
  the other prayers used in the outdoor portion of our service, not rising
  till the valedictory grace concluded the service. Indeed, I have never
  known (at least the <i>majority</i> of) those attending our funerals
  here, omit this old custom.</p>

  <p>That of dressing graves with flowers, at Easter and Whitsuntide,
  prevails here as in Wales: and the older folks still maintain the ancient
  practice of an obeisance as often as the Gloria occurs during the
  ordinary services. The last railful of communicants are also in the habit
  of remaining in their place at the altar rails till the service is
  concluded; but whether these observances are widely spread, or merely
  local, I have not had sufficient opportunity to judge.</p>

  <p class="author">J. T. P.</p>

  <p class="address">Dewchurch Vicarage.</p>

  <p>At the church of South Stoke, near Arundel, I have heard the clerk
  respond after the Gospel: "Thanks be to God for the Holy Gospel."</p>

  <p>At Southwick, near Brighton, the rector was wont (about four years
  since) to stand up at the "Glory" in the Litany.</p>

  <p>The Bishop of London believes bowing the head when the doxology, or
  ascription of praise, is pronounced, to be a novelty in our Church
  (Letter to the Knightsbridge Churchwarden, March 28, 1854). I remember an
  old woman regularly attending the services of Exeter Cathedral, who was
  wont always to curtsy at the "Glory." And in <i>The Guardian</i> of April
  25, W. G. T. alludes to a parish in Staffordshire where the custom
  prevails. And A. W. says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the western counties of England there are many parishes where the
  custom of bowing at the 'Gloria' has been universally observed by the
  poor from time immemorial. I could mention parishes in Worcestershire or
  Herefordshire where it has always prevailed."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It should be observed, that the custom is not to bow at the "Glory"
  only, but whenever, in the course of the service, the names of the Three
  Persons of the Blessed Trinity are mentioned. See Isaiah, vi. 2, 3.</p>

  <p>I have heard sermons commenced in the name of the Holy Trinity, and
  ended with "the Glory," the preacher repeating the former part and the
  congregation the latter. I believe this is agreeable to very ancient use.
  Can any one say whether it has anywhere been retained in our own
  Church?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. W. Hewett.</span></p>

  <p>The custom of Lincolnshire mentioned by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Ellacombe</span> as observed by his two parishioners at Bitton had its
  origin doubtless in the first rubric to the Order for the Administration
  of the Lord's Supper in our Book of Common Prayer, which enjoins
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"So many as intend to be partakers of the Holy Communion, shall
  signify their names to the Curate at least some time the day before."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On this Bishop Wilson remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is with great reason that the Church has given this order;
  wherefore do not neglect it."</p>

  <p>"You will have the comfort of knowing, either that your Pastor hath
  nothing to say against you, or, if he has, you will have the benefit of
  his advice: and a good blessing will attend your obedience to the
  Church's orders."</p>

  <p><i>Reverence to the Altar</i> (Vol. vi., p. 182.).&mdash;Statute XI.
  Such obeisance was always made in the college to which I belonged, at
  Oxford, to the Provost by every scholar, and by the Bible clerks when
  they proceeded from their seats to the eagle lectern, to read the lessons
  of the day.</p>

  <p class="author">I. R. R.</p>

  <p><i>Separation of the Sexes in Church.</i>&mdash;It was the custom a
  few years ago (and I have every reason <!-- Page 567 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="567.png"><a name="page567"></a>{567}</span>to
  believe it to be so at present), for the men to sit on one side of the
  aisle, and the women on the other, in the church of Grange, near Armagh,
  in the north of Ireland. No one remembered the introduction of the
  custom.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Abhba.</span></p>

  <p><i>Standing while the Lord's Prayer is read</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 127.
  257.).&mdash;The congregation of the English Episcopal Chapel at Dundee
  stood during the reading of the Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and
  the Song of the Angels at the birth of Christ, when these occur in the
  order of morning lessons. This congregation joined that of the Scottish
  Episcopalians several years ago, and whether the practice is continued in
  the present congregation I cannot say.</p>

  <p>In St. Paul's Chapel, Edinburgh, York Place, the congregation stand at
  the reading of the Ten Commandments in the fifth chapter of Deuteronomy,
  and they chant "Glory be to thee, O God," on the giving out of the
  Gospel, and "Thanks be to thee, O God," &amp;c., after the reading of it.
  In the Communion they sit during the reading of the Exhortation, "Dearly
  Beloved in the Lord;" and it is but very lately that they have stood when
  repeating "Glory be to God on high," &amp;c., in the Post Communion.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Henry Stephens.</span></p>

  <p>In Durham Cathedral, on Sept. 5, 1850, at the Anniversary of the Sons
  of the Clergy, the congregation rose simultaneously on the occurrence of
  the Lord's Prayer in the lesson. I remember also that the same custom was
  observed at Trinity Church, Chelsea, during the incumbency of the Rev.
  Henry Blunt. Where the Bidding Prayer enjoined by the 55th Canon is used
  (that, by-the-way, being the only authorised pulpit prayer), it is usual
  I believe for the people to stand during the Lord's Prayer; the preacher
  then teaching us to pray as our Lord taught His disciples. The short
  doxology at the end of the Gospel, to which <span class="sc">Mr.

  <p>This custom prevails generally in the Episcopalian churches in
  Scotland; and our congregations also stand up while the Commandments are
  read in course of the lessons. We have also the practice of singing,
  after the Gospel: "Thanks be to thee, O Lord, for this thy Holy
  Gospel!"</p>

  <p>This is the practice on the reading of this prayer in the second
  lesson at the parish church of Edgbaston, near Birmingham. It is probably
  a remanet of the ancient practice in the Church, not only to stand up
  during the reading of the Gospel, but throughout the whole service, as
  symbolic of the resurrection of Christ&mdash;the Lord's Day; which still
  exists in the Greek Church, and may be witnessed any Sunday in London, on
  visiting the recent edifice in London Wall.</p>

  <p><i>Tolling the Bell on leaving Church</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 125. 311,
  312.).&mdash;In this parish a bell is always rung on the conclusion of
  the morning service, to give notice that a sermon will be given at the
  evening service. This bell, which a very respectable old man, who was
  parish clerk here for fifty-four years, called the "sermon bell," is
  never tolled unless there is a second service. If at any time the morning
  service is not performed, the bell is tolled at twelve o'clock at noon to
  inform the parishioners that an evening service will take place. A bell
  is also rung at eight and nine o'clock on Sunday, or any other morning
  when morning prayer is said.</p>

  <p>The custom of ringing the church bell on Shrove Tuesday, as mentioned
  by <span class="sc">Newburiensis</span> (Vol. ix., p. 324.), is observed
  here too, and is generally called "the pancake bell."</p>

  <p class="author">C. F. P.</p>

  <p class="address">Normanton-upon-Soar, Notts.</p>

  <p>I am disposed to agree in opinion with E. W. I. as to this custom, not
  only as regards the priests, but the people also, for in most country
  parishes it is the signal for the baker&mdash;who usually cooks the
  Sunday's dinner of the humbler classes&mdash;to open his oven: and I have
  often heard old folks speak of it as "the pudding bell."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">G. Taylor.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Reading.</p>

  <p>The object is to announce that another service is to follow, either in
  the afternoon or evening, as the case may be. Here the tolling is, not as
  the congregation are leaving the church, but at one o'clock.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Wm. Hazel.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Portsmouth.</p>

  <p>E. W. I., in his answer to this Query in Vol. ix., p. 312., refers to
  the custom of tolling the church bell at eight o'clock on Sunday morning,
  and again at nine. This custom is followed at the chapel of ease (at
  Maidenhead) to the parishes of Bray and Cookham.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Newburiensis.</span></p>

  <p>"The pudding bell," as country folks sometimes call it (under the
  impression that its use is to warn those at home to get the dinner
  ready), is still rung in some of the old Lancashire parish churches as
  the congregation go out. But as in this county parish churches are
  scarce, and two full services quite a matter of course, W. S.'s <!-- Page
  568 --><span class="pagenum" title="568.png"><a
  name="page568"></a>{568}</span>reason cannot apply here. I remember well
  the custom of the congregations <i>kneeling</i> when the Lord's Prayer
  occurred in the lesson; it was left off in my own church about thirty
  years since, this custom, curtseying at the "Gloria," and some others,
  being considered <i>ignorant</i>, and therefore discountenanced by those
  who knew better.</p>

  <p><i>Arch-priest in the Diocese of Exeter</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 105.
  185.).&mdash;A question has been asked: "Does a dignity or office, such
  as rector of Haccombe, exist in the Anglican Church?" I find something
  similar in the case of the vicar of Newry, who is entirely free from
  ecclesiastical control; he holds his appointment from the ex-officio
  rector (Lord Kilmony), who derives his title from the original patent
  granted by Edward VI. to his Irish Marshal Sir Nicholas Pagnall, who, on
  the dissolution of the "Monasterium Nevoracense," obtained possession of
  the land attached, and was farther granted:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That he shall have all and singular, and so many and the like courts
  leet, frank pledge, law days, rights, jurisdictions, liberties,
  privileges, &amp;c. &amp;c., in as large, ample, and beneficial a manner
  as any abbot, prior, convent, or other chief, head, or governor of the
  late dissolved monastery heretofore seized, held or enjoyed," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The seal of the ancient charter, on which is inscribed the legend,
  "Sigillum exemptæ jurisdictionis de virido ligno alias Newry et Mourne,"
  is still used in the courts. A mitred abbot in his albe, sitting in his
  chair, supported by two yew-trees, is also engraved on it; to perpetuate
  (it is said) the tradition that these trees had been planted by St.
  Patrick in the vicinity of the convent.</p>

  <p><i>Holy-loaf Money</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 150. 256.).&mdash;In Normandy
  and Brittany, and probably in other Roman Catholic countries, bread is
  blessed by the officiating priest during the performance of high mass,
  and handed round in baskets to the congregation by the inferior officers
  of the church. On inquiring into the meaning of this custom, I was told
  that it represented the <i>agapæ</i> of the primitive church; and that,
  before the first revolution, every substantial householder in the parish
  was bound in turn to furnish the loaves, or a money equivalent. It is
  now, I believe, a voluntary gift of the more devout parishioners, or
  furnished out of the ordinary revenues of the church.</p>

<h3>POPIANA.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 445.)</p>

  <p>In <span class="sc">Mr. Harry Leroy Temple's</span> <i>Popiana</i>,
  allusion is made to Pope's <i>Imitation of Horace</i>, Second Satire,
  Book I., and the question is asked, In what modern editions of Pope is
  this Imitation to be found? It is in Warton's edition, and also in the
  Aldine edition published by Pickering. It appeared to me (as to Bowles,
  Roscoe, Mr. Cary, and others) too glaringly indecent for a popular
  edition of Pope. The poet never acknowledged it; he published it as
  "Imitated in the manner of Mr. Pope," but it is a genuine production. See
  note in my edition of Pope, vol. iv. p. 300.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Temple</span> says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Roscoe and Croly give <i>four</i> poems on <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>.
  Why does Mr. Carruthers leave out the third? His edition appears to
  contain (besides many additions) all that all previous editors have
  admitted, with the exception of the <i>third</i> Gulliver poem, the
  sixteen additional verses to Mrs. Blount on leaving town, the verses to
  Dr. Bolton, and a fragment of eight lines (perhaps by Congreve); which
  last three are to be found in Warton's edition."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The <i>third</i> Gulliver poem was not published with the others by
  Pope in the <i>Miscellanies</i>. It should, however, have been inserted,
  as it is acknowledged by Pope in his correspondence with Swift. The
  omission must be set down as an editorial oversight, to be remedied in
  the next edition. The verses on Dr. Bolton are assuredly <i>not</i>
  Pope's; they are printed in Aaron Hill's <i>Works</i>, 1753. See a
  copious note on this subject in "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vii., p. 113. The two
  other omissions noticed by <span class="sc">Mr. Temple</span> (with
  others unnoticed by him, as the parody on the First Psalm, &amp;c.) were
  dictated by the same feeling that prompted the exclusion of the
  <i>Imitation of Horace</i>. In several of Pope's letters, preserved at
  Maple Durham, are grossly indecent and profane passages, which he omitted
  himself in his printed correspondence, and which are wholly unfit for
  publication. The same oblivion should be extended to his unacknowledged
  poetical sins.</p>

<h3>CATHOLIC FLORAL DIRECTORIES</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., p.585.):
<i>Anthologia Borealis et Australis; Florilegium
Sanctarum Aspirationum</i>.</p>

  <p>Since I last wrote, I have not succeeded in unravelling the mystery
  which envelops these two works; but I have gotten some clue to it, for
  which I am indebted to the extreme courtesy and kindness of two
  correspondents.</p>

  <p>One of these gentlemen informs me that the <i>Anthologia</i> is quoted
  at p. 280. of Dr. Forster's work on the Atmosphere: London, 1823. My <!--
  Page 569 --><span class="pagenum" title="569.png"><a
  name="page569"></a>{569}</span>second correspondent writes to say, "If
  you can procure the <i>Circle of the Seasons</i>, by Dr. Forster,
  published in 1830, you will there find very copious extracts from the
  books in question." Before we go any farther I would ask, <i>is</i> Dr.
  Forster the author of this book? The copy I have met with in a public
  library is anonymous, and is thus entitled: <i>The Circle of the Seasons,
  and Perpetual Key to the Calendar and Almanac</i>: London, Thomas
  Hookham, 1828, pp. 432. 12mo. It is a valuable book, and forms a complete
  Catholic Floral Directory. Though the <i>Anthologia</i> and the
  <i>Florilegium</i> are lavishly quoted, no references are given save the
  bare names.</p>

  <p>It is easy to see why Mr. Weale, the "compiler" of the <i>Catholic
  Florist</i>, declined giving the information requested. The quotations in
  question are all <i>second-hand</i> from the <i>Circle of the
  Seasons</i>. The very preface of the <i>Florist</i> is not original; the
  most valuable part of it (commencing at p. 11.) I have discovered to be a
  verbatim reprint from <i>The Truthteller</i>, or, rather, from Hone's
  <i>Every-Day Book</i>, vol. i. pp. 103. 303., where some extracts are
  given from the contributions to this periodical from a correspondent with
  the signature <i>Crito</i>. These quotations in Hone first drew my
  attention to <i>The Truthteller</i>, and I advertised for it, but without
  success. It was edited, I believe, by Thomas Andrews. I have met with the
  second series of this periodical, published in London in 1825, and I
  should be glad to get the whole of it.<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In Forster's <i>Perennial Calendar</i>, London, 1824, the
  <i>Anthologia</i> is quoted at pp. 101. 108. 173. 211. 265. 295.: one of
  these passages is requoted in Hone, vol. i. p. 383. I may here remark
  that this work of Hone's is furnished with a <i>Floral Directory</i>.</p>

  <p>I feel rather piqued, both on my own account and for the honour of "N.
  &amp; Q.," at being baffled by two English books, and I am somewhat
  surprised that thirty years should have elapsed without any inquiry
  having been made respecting the remarkable quotations adduced by Dr.
  Forster. The Queries I now propose are: Who was the compiler of the
  <i>Circle of the Seasons</i>? Are the <i>Anthologia</i> and the
  <i>Florilegium</i> quoted in any works previous to Forster's time?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Eirionnach.</span></p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;Can I get a copy of the <i>Catholic Friend</i>, which is
  referred to in the preface of the <i>Catholic Florist</i> as a scarce and
  valuable work; and also a copy of the <i>Catholic Instructor</i>: London,
  1844?</p>

  <p>[<i>The Truthteller</i> was discontinued at the end of vol. i. The
  first number was published Sept. 25, 1824, and the last on Sept. 17,
  1825. The publisher and editor, W. A. Andrews, closes his labours with
  the following remarks: "Having given <i>The Truthteller</i> a year's
  trial, we feel ourselves called upon, as a matter of justice to our
  family, to discontinue it as a newspaper. The negligence of too many of
  our subscribers, in not discharging their engagements to us, and the
  indifference of others of the Catholic body, to support the vindicator of
  their civil and religious principles, leave us no alternative but that of
  dropping it as a newspaper, or carrying it on at a loss." Only two of
  Crito's papers on Botany were given in <i>The Truthteller</i>, viz. in
  No. 15., p. 115., and No. 16., p. 123. He probably continued them in
  <i>The Catholic Friend</i>, also published by W. A. Andrews.</p>

  <p>The following extract from a letter signed F., and dated Jan. 4, 1825,
  given in <i>The Truthteller</i>, vol. i. No. 16. p. 126., recommends the
  publication, among other works, of a "<span class="sc">Catholic
  Calendar</span>. There should also be a Catholic Calendar, something like
  <i>The Perennial Calendar</i>, but more portable, and fuller of religious
  information, in which, under each saint, his or her particular virtues,
  intelligence, good works, or martyrdom, should be succinctly set forth,
  so as to form a sort of calendar of human triumphs, such as is
  recommended by Mr. Counsellor Basil Montagu in his Essays." In a note the
  writer adds, "This I believe will soon be undertaken." This letter seems
  to have been written by Dr. Forster.&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Ed.</span>]</p>

</div>
  <p>Thanks to <span class="sc">Mr. Pinkerton</span>, I am enabled to turn
  my surmise into certainty, and have the pleasure of clearing up a
  literary <i>hoax</i>, which has, it seems, passed without challenge till
  my note of interrogation appeared in these pages. The <i>Anthologia</i>
  and the <i>Florilegium</i> are purely imaginary titles for certain pieces
  in prose and verse, the production of Dr. Forster, and have no existence
  save in the <i>Circle of the Seasons</i>.</p>

  <p>In the Autobiography of the eccentric Doctor&mdash;which is entitled
  <i>Recueil de ma Vie, mes Ouvrages et mes Pensées: Opuscule
  Philosophique</i>, par Thomas Ignace Marie Forster: Bruxelles,
  1836&mdash;at p. 55. he enumerates the <i>Anthologia</i> and
  <i>Florilegium</i> among his "Pièces Fugitives," and ends the list in the
  following words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Encore je me confesse d'avoir écrit toutes ces essais détachés dans
  le <i>Perennial Calendar</i>, auxquels j'ai attaché quelques signatures,
  ou plus proprement des lettres, comme A. B. S. R. etc."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the solitude of his garden at Hartwell he conceived the idea of
  making a Floral Directory, which he eventually carried out, and published
  under the title of the <i>Circle of the Seasons</i>. See p. 21.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Pinkerton</span> has most kindly lent me a rare
  and privately-printed book of Forster's, entitled <i>Harmonia Musarum,
  containing Nugæ Cantabrigenses, Florilegium Sanctæ Aspirationis, and
  Anthologia Borealis et Australis</i>, chiefly from a College Album,
  edited by Alumnus Cantabrigensis (N.B. Not published): 1843, pp. 144,
  8vo.</p>

  <p>The preface is signed T. F., and is dated "Bruges, Sept. 15, 1843." In
  it he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The harmony of the Muses has been divided into three parts&mdash;the
  first being the <i>Nugæ Cantab</i>. The <!-- Page 570 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="570.png"><a name="page570"></a>{570}</span>second
  contains the sacred subjects, hymns, &amp;c., written chiefly by a
  relation, and formerly collected under the title of <i>Florilegium Sanctæ
  Aspirationis</i>. The third consists merely of a small collection of
  Latin verses selected by some student, with occasional notes from the
  rest, and called <i>Fragments from North and South</i>: they have, many
  at least, been printed before."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is impossible to give an idea of this extraordinary Olla; we have
  in it pieces of Porson, Gray, and Byron, &amp;c., Cowper's <i>John
  Gilpin</i>, and Coleridge's <i>Devil's Walk</i>; at p. 19. we have
  "Spring Impromptu, found among some old papers," with the signature "N."
  attached, which turns out to be Gray on the "Pleasures of Vicissitude." I
  regret to say that this volume contains much that is coarse and
  offensive, which is the less excusable, and the more surprising, as
  coming from the author of the very beautiful and devotional pieces
  published in the <i>Circle of the Seasons</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Florilegium</i> and the <i>Anthologia</i> of the <i>Circle</i>
  have little in common with their namesakes in the <i>Harmonia</i>, which
  latter contain poems by Southwell, Byron, Gray, Hogg, Porson, Jortin,
  &amp;c., but none of Forster's prose pieces, which form so large a
  portion of the other <i>Florilegium</i> and <i>Anthologia</i>. Dr.
  Forster's life would make a very entertaining biography, and I should be
  glad to know more about him, whether he be yet alive, what books he
  printed at Bruges, &amp;c.<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In concluding this matter, I beg to return my best thanks to <span
  class="sc">Mr. Pinkerton</span> for the valuable information he so freely
  imparted to me, and the handsome manner in which he placed it at my
  disposal.</p>

<div class="note">
  <a name="footnote2"></a><b>Footnote 2:</b><a

  <p>Dr. Forster was born in London in 1789, of an ancient Catholic family;
  he was himself a Protestant until the year 1835, when it appears that he
  became a convert to the Church of Rome: at the same time he received the
  additional names of Ignatius Maria. It is most probable that he is yet
  alive and in Belgium, where he has resided for many years. The Editor of
  "N. &amp; Q." has kindly sent me a list from the Catalogue of the British
  Museum, of some four and thirty works by Dr. Forster. There is, however,
  another book by Dr. Forster not contained in the Museum list,
  <i>Onthophilos, ou Les Derniers Entretiens d'un Philosophe Catholique</i>
  (Brussels?), 1836.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Mr. Lyte's New Instantaneous Process.</i>&mdash;I beg to
  communicate to you a new process in photography, which is by far the most
  rapid I believe yet discovered, and combines at the same time great
  stability. It has been the result of a great many experiments on my part,
  and even now I am hardly prepared to say that it is brought to its
  fullest perfection; but it suffices to say that it is sufficiently rapid
  to give pictures of the waves of the sea in motion with perfect
  sharpness, and ships sailing at ten knots an hour, and puttling up and
  down at the same time, and all with a landscape lens. By it also, and by
  the same lens, we may take instantaneous portraits. The process is as
  follows:&mdash;After the plate, prepared with the collodion and
  sensitised with the nitrate bath, as I have described in one of your
  former Numbers, is taken from the bath, I pour over it a solution
  composed as follows:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar"> 1.</td>
<td> Take&mdash;</td>
<td class="ar"> </td>
<td class="pl025"> </td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> </td>

<td class="pl025"> ounces.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> </td>
<td colspan="2"> Iodide of silver, as much as will dissolve.</td>
<td class="pl025"> </td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> </td>
<td class="pl2 pb2"> Mix and filter.</td>
<td class="ar"> </td>
<td class="pl025"> </td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> 2.</td>
<td> Take&mdash;</td>
<td class="ar"> </td>
<td class="pl025"> </td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> </td>
<td style="padding-right:5em"> Grape sugar or honey</td>
<td class="ar"> 8</td>
<td class="pl025"> ounces.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> </td>
<td> Water</td>
<td class="ar"> 6</td>
<td class="pl025"> ounces.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> </td>
<td> Alcohol</td>
<td class="ar"> 1</td>
<td class="pl025"> ounce.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> </td>
<td class="pl2"> Mix, dissolve, and filter.</td>
<td class="ar"> </td>
<td class="pl025"> </td></tr>
</table>

  <p>And when required for use, mix equal parts of these solutions, and
  pour them over the plate. The plate is to be allowed to drain; and then,
  when placed in the frame, is ready for the camera, and is easily
  impressed as a deep negative by a Ross's landscape lens instantaneously.
  To develop, I use always the same agents as I have before specified. One
  or two cautions are to be observed in this process. First, the
  grape-sugar or honey must be quite pure, and free from any <i>strong</i>
  acid re-action; and, secondly, these substances are much improved by a
  long exposure to the air, by which the oxidation of them is commenced,
  and the result made much more certain and effective. However, I find that
  the addition of the least possible quantity of nitric acid has the same
  effect; but nothing is so good as long exposure of the sugar or honey, so
  as to become completely candied before mixing. The sugar may as
  conveniently of course be mixed in the collodion as in the bath, but in
  that case the keeping properties are lost, as the plate is not thus kept
  longer moist than usual. If, however, the former process be used and well
  conducted, the plate when sensitised may be kept for four hours at least
  without injury.</p>

  <p>The grape sugar should be made with oxalic, and the acid removed by
  lime as usual, and not with sulphuric acid, as is often done; as in the
  latter case sulpho-saccharic acid is formed, which much injures the
  result.</p>

  <p>I have been trying numerous experiments in this line, and I think I
  have almost hit upon another and quite new and instantaneous process; but
  as it is only in embryo, I will not give it to you till perfect. There
  are of course many other substances to be yet mixed in the bath or the
  collodion, <i>e. g.</i> all the alkaloids, or indeed any of the
  deoxidating agents known, and probably with good results. I am still
  continuing my experiments on this head, and if I make any farther
  improvements I will lose no time in communicating them to you. Some
  negatives taken by this means were exhibited on Friday evening at the
  Royal Institution, and were much admired.</p>

  <p><i>Photographs, &amp;c. of the Crystal Palace.</i>&mdash;All who have

  collodion negatives taken by <span class="sc">Mr. Delamotte</span>, who,
  combining the taste of the artist with the skill of the photographer, has
  succeeded in producing some most effective views of this new Temple of
  Education. At Lord Rosse's soirée on Saturday last, the closing one
  unfortunately of those most agreeable reunions, Mr. Williams exhibited
  three daguerreotypes, taken that morning, of the ceremony of opening the
  Crystal Palace, which, although only about three inches by five,
  contained some hundreds of figures. The portraits of the Queen and the
  brilliant cortege which surrounded her at the moment were strikingly
  effective.</p>

  <p><i>Soluble Cotton.</i>&mdash;In answer to the observations of H. U.
  (Vol. ix., p. 548.), I should imagine that the nitrate of potash used was
  not thoroughly dried; and consequently, the amount of water used was in
  excess of that directed. The temperature should be from 120° to 130°
  Fahr. And thermometers of a proper construction (with the lower part of
  the scale to bend up from the bulb) can be obtained in abundance at from
  1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> at several of the makers in Hatton
  Garden or elsewhere.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Geo. Shadbolt.</span></p>

  <p><i>Cameras.</i>&mdash;At one of the earliest meetings of the
  Photographic Society, I suggested the use of papier maché as a material
  for the construction of cameras, as possessing <i>nearly</i> all the
  requisite qualities; but there is one serious objection to its
  application to this purpose, its <i>brittleness</i>, as a smart blow is
  apt to snap it like a biscuit. I think, however, upon the whole, that if
  a peculiar kind of <i>Honduras</i> mahogany, such as is used for coach
  panels, is adopted, the possessor would never desire a change. It should
  be as plain as a piece of deal, without the slightest beauty of grain,
  which is positive detriment to a camera, from the accompanying liability
  to warping.</p>

  <p><i>Shakspeare Portrait</i> (Vol. viii., p. 438.).&mdash;J. S. Smith,

  <p>"Clarkson, the portrait painter, was originally a coach-panel and sign
  painter; and he executed that most elaborate one of Shakspeare, which
  formerly hung across the street at the north-east corner of Little

  that he had often heard his father say, that this sign cost <i>five
  hundred pounds!</i> In my boyish days it was for many years exposed for
  sale for a very trifling sum, at a broker's shop in Lower Brook Street,
  Grosvenor Square. The late Mr. Crace, of Great Queen Street, assured me
  that it was in his early days a thing that country people would stand and
  gaze at, and that that corner of the street was hardly passable."</p>

  <p>Edwards, in his <i>Anecdotes of Painters</i> (p. 117.), assigns the
  portrait to a different painter, Samuel Wale, R.A. His account, however,
  being more minute than Smith's, is worth transcribing:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mr. Wale painted some signs; the principal one was a whole-length of
  Shakspeare, about five feet high, which was executed for, and displayed
  before the door of a public-house, the north-west corner of Little
  Russell Street, in Drury Lane. It was enclosed in a most sumptuous carved
  gilt frame, and suspended by rich iron work; but this splendid object of
  attraction did not hang long before it was taken down, in consequence of
  the act of parliament which passed for paving, and also for removing the
  signs and other obstructions in the streets of London. Such was the total
  change of fashion, and the consequent disuse of signs, that the above
  representation of our great dramatic poet was sold for a trifle to Mason
  the broker, in Lower Grosvenor Street; where it stood at his door for
  several years, until it was totally destroyed by the weather and other
  accidents."</p>

  <p><i>Willow Bark in Ague</i> (Vol. ix., p. 452.).&mdash;In the
  <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> (1835?) is a memoir by the Rev. E.
  Stone, of Chipping Norton, of the salutary effects of the bark of the
  Duck Willow in agues and intermittent fevers. The author states, that
  being dried in an oven, and pounded, and administered in doses of one
  drachm every four hours in the intervals of the paroxysms, it soon
  reduces the distemper; and, except in very severe cases, removes it
  entirely. With the addition of one fifth part of Peruvian bark, it <!--
  Page 572 --><span class="pagenum" title="572.png"><a
  name="page572"></a>{572}</span>becomes a specific against these
  disorders, and never fails to remove them. One advantage it possesses of
  influencing the patient beneficially immediately it is adopted, without
  the necessity of preparation previously. It is a safe medicine, and may
  be taken in water or tea.</p>

  <p>I copy the above from an entry in an old notebook. I imagine the Duck
  Willow to be the Common White Willow (<i>Salix albæ vulgaris</i>) of

  all calculated to shake the opinion which I expressed touching the barony
  of Fairfax of Cameron. The case of the earldom of Newburgh, which your

  all the "Peerages," and even than the Roll of Scottish Peers. As to the
  Irish case&mdash;that of the Earl of Athlone&mdash;I can but repeat my
  Query. Whether right or wrong, it is not binding on the British House of
  Lords. The cases of the King of Hanover, the Duke of Wellington, and Earl
  Nelson, are not in point. His Hanoverian Majesty is not an alien; and
  though some British subjects may be recognised as peers by foreign
  states, it does not follow that a foreigner can be a peer of Britain.</p>

  As a widow, she lived in Paris as the Countess of Albany, but in her
  drawing-room called herself Queen of Great Britain. She was alive at the

  Bowling-green, ceased to be a place of public amusement about the year
  1810. It is now occupied by a group of houses called <i>Dobney's
  Place</i>, near the bottom of Penton Street. The late Mr. Upcott had a
  drawing of Prospect House (as the building was called), taken about 1780.
  A hand-bill of the year 1772 (in a volume formerly belonging to Lysons)
  thus describes the nature of Wildman's performance:</p>

  <p>"<i>The Bees on Horseback.</i>&mdash;Daniel Wildman rides, standing
  upright, one foot on the saddle, and the other on the horse's neck, with
  a curious mask of bees on his face. He also rides standing upright on the
  saddle, with the bridle in his mouth, and, by firing a pistol, makes one
  part of the bees march over a table, and the other part swarm in the air,
  and return to their proper places again."</p>

  <p>Sampson, Price, Johnson, and Coningham were celebrated equestrian
  performers towards the close of the last century. Astley was the pupil of
  Sampson, and his successor in agility. Bromley, in his <i>Catalogue of

  <p><i>Hero of the "Spanish Lady's Love"</i> (Vol. ix., p.
  305.).&mdash;Concerning the origin of this interesting old ballad, the
  following communication appeared in <i>The Times</i> of May 1, 1846. It
  is dated from Coldrey, Hants, and signed Charles Lee:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The hero of this beautiful ballad was my ancestor, Sir John Bolle of
  Thorpe Hall, Lincolnshire, of most ancient and loyal family, and father
  of that Colonel Bolle who fell in Alton Church, whilst fighting against
  the rebels in December, 1643. Of the truth of this I am prepared to give
  the curious in these matters the most abundant evidence, but the space
  which the subject would occupy would necessarily exclude it from your
  columns.</p>

  <p>"The writer of the paper in the <i>Edinburgh</i> says:&mdash;'Had the
  necklace been still extant, the preference would have been due to
  Littlecot.' The necklace is still extant, in the possession of a member
  of my family, and in the house whence I write. In Illingworth's
  <i>Topographical Account of Scampton, with Anecdotes of the Family of
  Bolles</i>, it is stated: 'The portrait of Sir John, drawn in 1596, at
  the age of thirty-six years, having on the gold chain given him by the
  Spanish Lady, &amp;c., is still in the possession of his descendant,
  Capt. Birch.'</p>

  <p>"That portrait is now in the possession of Capt. Birch's successor,
  Thomas Bosvile Bosvile, Esq., of Ravensfield Park, Yorkshire, my brother,
  and may be seen by any one. I will only add another extract from
  Illingworth's <i>Scampton</i>:&mdash;'On Sir John Bolle's departure from
  Cadiz, the Spanish Lady sent as presents to his wife, a profusion of
  jewels and other valuables, amongst which was her portrait drawn in
  green; plate, money, and other treasure. Some articles are still in
  possession of the family; though her picture was unfortunately, and by
  accident, disposed of about half a century since. This portrait being
  drawn in green, gave occasion to her being called, in the neighbourhood
  of Thorpe Hall, the Green Lady; where, to this day, there is a
  traditionary superstition among the vulgar, that Thorpe Hall was haunted
  by the Green Lady, who used nightly to take her seat in a particular tree
  near the mansion.' In Illingworth there is a long and full account of the
  Spanish Lady, and the ballad is given at length."</p>

  <p><i>Hymn attributed to Handel</i> (Vol. ix., p. 303.).&mdash;I do not
  understand whether <span class="sc">Mr. Storer's</span> Query refers to
  the <i>words</i> or <i>music</i> of this hymn. If to the former, it is
  most assuredly not Handel's. It is strange that the church does not
  possess one <i>genuine</i> psalm or hymn tune of this mighty master,
  although he certainly composed several. The popular melody called
  <i>Hanover</i>, usually attributed to Handel, was printed in the
  <i>Supplement to the New Version of Psalms</i> (a collection of tunes) in
  1703. Handel did not arrive in England till 1710. It is improbable, from
  many circumstances, that he composed this grand melody. It was probably
  the work of Dr. Croft.</p>

  <p>D'Almaine, the eminent music-seller of Soho Square, published some
  years back&mdash;</p>

  contrary one; and who requested Handel to set to music the <i>Three

  <p><i>Marquis of Granby</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 127. 360.).&mdash;In a
  critique which appeared in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for January or
  April, 1838, on Dickens's earlier works, it is stated that Sumpter, a
  discharged soldier of the royal regiment of Horse Guards, opened a
  public-house at Hounslow, having as its sign "The Marquis of Granby,"
  which was the first occasion of the marquis's name appearing on the
  sign-board of a public-house. This note appeared in reference to the
  public-house kept at Dorking by Mrs. Weller, the "second wentur" of Tony
  Weller, father of the immortal Samivel, of that ilk.</p>

  <p>John, Marquis of Granby, was colonel of the royal regiment of Horse
  Guards from May 13, 1758, to his decease, which occurred Oct. 19, 1770,
  and was justly considered the soldier's friend. (See Captain Packer's
  <i>History of the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards</i>, p. 95.) Mr.
  Dickens, in his description of the sign-board at Dorking, has arrayed the
  marquis in the uniform, not of the regiment, but of a general officer: he
  states,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On the opposite side of the road was a sign-board representing the
  head and shoulders of a gentleman with an apoplectic countenance, in a
  red coat, with deep blue facings, and a touch of the same over his
  three-cornered hat for a sky. Over that, again, were a pair of flags, and
  beneath the last button of his coat were a couple of cannon; and the
  whole formed an expressive and undoubted likeness of the Marquis of
  Granby of glorious memory."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Witty, I admit, but that "touch of the same" (blue <i>facings</i>?)
  for a sky is ambiguous. <i>Brevis esse laboro, obscurus fio.</i></p>

  <p>The uniform of the royal regiment of Horse Guards, from 1758 to 1770,
  consisted of a dark blue coatee, with red facings, red breeches, jacked
  boots, and three-cornered hats bound with gold lace.</p>

  <p><i>Convocation and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel</i>
  (Vol. viii., p. 100.).&mdash;The Archdeacon of Stafford, in his last

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He was not aware that the two venerable societies, The Society for
  the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, and The Society for
  Promoting Christian Knowledge, owed their existence to it."</p>

  <p>Atterbury, writing to Bishop Trelawny, March 15, 1700-1, says:</p>

  Propagating the Christian Religion in Foreign Parts, who sat the first
  time this afternoon in the Chapter House of St. Paul's"&mdash;Atterbury's
  <i>Correspondence</i>, vol. i. p. 88.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Though the venerable Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in
  Foreign Parts does not owe, strictly speaking, its <i>existence</i> to

  desirous of completing. It will be seen to convey a charming lesson of
  amiable sociality&mdash;admirably adapted <i>d'ailleurs</i> to the pages
  of a work which seeks to encourage "intercommunications." It runs
  thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="i1hg3">"Said one little cat,</p>
      <p class="i1">To the other little cat,</p>

      <p class="i6">I must.</p>
      <p>If you don't speak, I must."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="sc">Julia R. Bockett</span> will doubtless feel with me,
  that though the antithesis requires that the "I" should be strongly
  emphasised in the first case, the sentiment expressed imperatively
  demands an intense force to be given to the "must" in the second
  repetition.</p>

  <p class="author">T. A. T.</p>

  <p class="address">Florence.</p>

  <p>P. S.&mdash;By-the-bye, talking of cats, there is a story current,
  that a certain archbishop, who sits neither at Canterbury nor York,
  having once, in unbending mood, demanded of one of his clergy if he could
  decline "cat," corrected the reverend catechumen, when, having arrived at
  the vocative case, he gave it, "Vocative, O cat!" and declared such
  declension to be wrong, and that the vocative of "cat" was "<i>puss</i>."
  Of course, it will be henceforth considered so in the diocese presided
  over by the prelate in question, as the gender of "carrosse" was changed
  throughout <i>la belle France</i>, by a blunder of the <i>grand
  monarque</i>. But surely the archbishop was as palpably wrong as the king
  was. At least, if he was not, we have only the alternative of considering
  Shakspeare to have blundered. For, have we not Stefano's address to poor
  Caliban:</p>

  tailless; or, if not exactly without tails, the tails they have are so
  short as to be called so merely by the extremest courtesy. This is the
  only respect, however, in which they differ from other cats.</p>

  author of several pamphlets. He published in the year 1723 a treatise in
  recommendation of the medicinal use of water as "a universal remedy," as
  well by drinking as by applying it externally to the body. In the British
  Museum there is a French translation of it, which appeared in Paris,
  <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1725. This is a proof of the notoriety which
  the treatise obtained. The tenth edition, dated "Edinburgh, 1740,"
  contains additions communicated by Mr. Ralph Thoresby, F.R.S., and
  others. In the year 1695 he published a short treatise entitled <i>A
  designed End to the Socinian Controversy; or, a rational and plain
  Discourse to prove, that no other Person but the Father of Christ is God
  Most High</i>. This attracted the notice of the civil power, and by order
  of parliament it was burnt, and the author prosecuted. (See Wallace's

  not Lord Brougham's book before me, but I have no doubt but that Q. has
  missed the meaning of his lordship. The reference would probably be to
  Horne Tooke's anticipation of the strange immoral reveries of Emerson and
  others, that <i>truth</i> is entirely subjective; because the word bears
  etymological relation to "to trow," to think, or believe: and so
  <i>truth</i> has no objective existence, but is merely what a man
  troweth. If that be an argument, Lord Brougham would say then the law of
  libel would be unjust, merely because "libel" means primarily a little
  book; he might have added that, according to Horne Tooke and Mr. Emerson,
  if a man had been killed by falling against a post at Charing Cross, a
  jury might deny the fact of the violent death, because "post" means a
  place for depositing letters, and he had not been near St.
  Martin's-le-grand. The remark of Lord Brougham is not as to a fact, but
  is a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">W. Denton.</span></p>

  <p>It is suggested to Q. (Bloomsbury), that Lord Brougham meant not to
  say that Horne Tooke <i>had ever held</i> or <i>maintained</i> this
  strange doctrine, "that the law of libel was unjust and absurd, because
  libel means a little book," but that he <i>would</i> have done so, or
  might have done so consistently with his etymological theory, namely,
  that the <i>present</i> sense of words is to be sought in their primitive
  signification: <i>e.g.</i>, in the <i>Diversions of Purley</i>, vol. ii.
  p. 403., Horne Tooke says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>True</i>, as we now write it, or <i>trew</i>, as it was formerly
  written, means simply and merely that which is <i>trowed</i>; and,
  instead of its being a rare commodity upon earth, except only in words,
  there is nothing but truth in the world."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If we ought <i>now</i> to use the word truth only in this sense, then,
  <i>pari ratione</i>, we ought to mean only a little book when we use the
  word libel.</p>

  <p><i>Irish Rhymes</i> (Vol. viii., p. 250.).&mdash;A. B. C. asks, "Will
  any one say it was through ignorance <!-- Page 576 --><span

  (Swift) did not sound the <i>g</i> in dressing?" Now I cannot tell
  whether or not I shall raise a nest of hornets about my ears, but my
  private impression is that in doing so Swift meant to be "more
  <i>English</i> and less nice." I think it invariably strikes an Irishman
  as one of the most remarkable peculiarities of the English people, the
  almost constant omission of that letter from every word ending (I should
  have said, if I was an Englishman, "endin'") with it. The fair sex, I
  fear I must add, are, of the two, rather more decided in clippin'
  (<i>g</i>) the Queen's English.</p>

  <p><i>Mantel-piece</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 302. 385.).&mdash;In old
  farm-houses, where the broad, open fireplace and hearth still exist, a
  small curtain, or rather valance, is often suspended from below the
  mantle-shelf, the object apparently being the exclusion of draughts and
  smoke. May not the use of this sort of <i>mantel</i> have caused the part
  of the fireplace from which it hangs to be called the mantel-piece?</p>

  <p><i>"Perturbabantur," &amp;c.</i> (Vol. ix., p. 452.).&mdash;When I
  first learned to scan verses, somewhere about thirty years ago, the lines
  produced by your correspondent P. were in every child's mouth, with this
  story attached to them. It was said that Oxford had received from
  Cambridge the first line of the distich, with a challenge to produce a
  corresponding line consisting of two words only. To this challenge Oxford
  replied by sending back the second line, pointing out, at the same time,
  the false quantity in the word "Constantin&#x14F;politani."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Sansom.</span></p>

  <p>The story connected with these lines current at Cambridge in my time
  was, that the University of Oxford challenged the sister university to
  match the first line; to which challenge the second line was promptly
  returned from Cambridge by way of reply. At Oxford, I believe, the story
  is reversed, as neither university is willing to own to the false
  quantity in "Constantin&#x14F;politani."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Eastwood</span>, M.A.</p>

  <p>The classic legend attached to these two lines (and there are only two
  in the legend) is that the Oxonians sent a challenge to the Cantabs to
  make <!-- Page 577 --><span class="pagenum" title="577.png"><a
  name="page577"></a>{577}</span>a binomial pentameter corresponding to
  "Perturbabantur Constantinopolitani." The Cantabs immediately returned
  the challenge by sending "Innumerabilibus sollicitudinibus." Perhaps it
  is worthy of remark, though not evident except to a Greek scholar, that
  the first line contains at least <i>one</i> false quantity, for
  "Constantinopol&#x12D;tani" must have the antepenultima long, as being
  derived from <span title="politês" class="grk"
  >&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&#x1F77;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>. The lengthening
  of the fourth syllable may perhaps have been considered as a
  compensation, though rather a <i>præ-posterous</i> one.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Charles De la Pryme.</span></p>

  <p>I remember to have heard that the history of these two lines is as
  follows:&mdash;The head of one of our public schools having a talent for
  composing extraordinary verses, sent the first line, "Perturbabantur
  Constantinopolitani," to a friend of his, who was at the time the captain
  of another public school, asking him at the same time whether he could
  compose anything like it. The answer returned was the second line,
  "Innumerabilibus sollicitudinibus,"&mdash;a line, in my opinion, much
  superior to the former, as well for other reasons as that it is free from
  any false quantity; while, as any Greek scholar will at once find out,
  the antepenultimate syllable of "Constantinopolitani" must be long, being
  derived from the Greek word <span title="politês" class="grk"
  >&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&#x1F77;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>.</p>

  <p>I never heard of any more lines of the same description.</p>

  <p class="author">P. A. H.</p>

  <p>I have always understood that once upon a time the Eton boys, or those
  of some other public school, sent the hexameter verse, "Perturbabantur
  Constantinopolitani," to the Winchester boys, challenging them to produce
  a pentameter verse consisting of only two words, and making sense. The
  Winchester boys added, "Innumerabilibus sollicitudinibus."</p>

  <p><i>Perspective</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 300. 378.).&mdash;I shall be glad of
  a reference to any work on Perspective which treats satisfactorily of
  that part of the subject on which I made my Note. I think if <span
  class="sc">Mr. Ferrey</span> will draw a lofty building on either side of
  a landscape, he will not be satisfied with its appearance, if he makes
  that side of it which is in the plane of the picture perfectly
  rectangular. I often meet with instances in which it is so drawn, and
  they produce the effect on me of a note out of time. <span class="sc">Mr.
  Stilwell</span>'s observation is only partially correct. There is one
  position of the eye, at a fixed distance from the picture, at which all
  the lines subtend equal angles at the eye with the corresponding lines of
  the original landscape. But a picture is not to be looked at from one
  point, and that at, probably, an inconvenient proximity to the eye. I
  have before me a print (in the <i>Ill. Lond. News</i>) of the interior of
  St. Paul's, of which the dome gives about as good an idea of proportion
  to the building, as the north part of Mercator's projection of the World.
  The whole building is depressed and top-heavy, simply because the
  perspective of lines in the plane of the picture is rectangular
  throughout. I have another interior (of Winchester Cathedral, by Owen
  Carter), which, being drawn on the same plan, gives the idea of a
  <i>squat tunnel</i>, unless looked at from one point of view, about eight
  inches from the picture. I feel that drawing these interiors so as not to
  offend the eye by either the excess or deficiency of perspective, is a
  great difficulty. But I think something may be done in the way of
  "humouring" the perspective, and approximating in our drawing to that
  which we know we see. The camera has thrown light upon the subject. We
  ought not to despise altogether the hints it gives us by its perhaps
  exaggerated perspective, in the case of parallel lines in the plane of
  the picture. I hope I may at least be able to draw out some more remarks
  upon a subject which I cannot help thinking, with Mr. <span
  class="sc">Ingleby</span>, is in an unsatisfactory and defective
  state.</p>

  <p>"<i>Go to Bath</i>" (Vol. ix., p. 421.).&mdash;I have little doubt but
  that this phrase is connected with the fact of Bath's being proverbially
  the resort of beggars; and what more natural, to one acquainted with this
  fact, than to bid an importunate applicant betake himself thither to join
  his fellows? See also Fuller's <i>Worthies</i> (co. Somerset).</p>

  <p>I transcribe the passage for the benefit of those who have not the
  book at hand:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Beggars of Bath.</i>&mdash;Many in that place; some natives there,
  others repairing thither from all parts of the land; the poor for alms,
  the pained for ease. Whither should fowl flock in a hard frost, but to
  the barn-door? Here, all the two seasons, being the general confluence of
  gentry. Indeed laws are daily made to restrain beggars, and daily broken
  by the connivance of those who make them; it being impossible when the
  hungry belly barks, and bowels sound, to keep the tongue silent. And
  although oil of whip <!-- Page 578 --><span class="pagenum" title="578.png"
  ><a name="page578"></a>{578}</span>be the proper plaister for the cramp
  of laziness, yet some pity is due to impotent persons. In a word, seeing
  there is the Lazar's-bath in this city, I doubt not but many a good
  Lazarus, the true object of charity, may beg therein."</p>

  <p>R. R. inquires the origin of the above saying, but has forgotten the
  context, viz. "and get your head shaved." I have often heard it explained
  as an allusion to the fact, that, in former days, persons who showed
  symptoms of insanity were sent to Bath to drink the medicinal waters; the
  process of shaving the head being previously resorted to. The saying is
  applied to those who either relate "crack-brained" stories, or propose
  undertakings that raise a doubt as to their sanity.</p>

  <p><i>Ridings and Chaffings</i> (Vol. ix., p. 370.).&mdash;Though unable
  to give <span class="sc">Mr. Thomas Russell Potter</span> any information
  respecting the "Ridings and Chaffings" of Nottinghamshire and
  Leicestershire, I send the following note of a somewhat similar custom
  prevalent in Oxfordshire (I never heard of it elsewhere), thinking it may
  perhaps interest him and others of your correspondents.</p>

  <p>I remember once, about three years ago, I was walking in Blenheim
  Park, with a friend then resident at Woodstock, when suddenly the
  stillness of a summer evening was broken by strange and inharmonious
  sounds, coming to us across the water from the old town. The sounds grew
  louder and louder, and in great surprise I appealed to my friend for an
  explanation; when I learned that it was a custom in that part of the
  country, whenever it was discovered that a man had been beating his wife,
  for the neighbours to provide themselves with all sorts of instruments,
  fire-irons, kettles, and pots, in fine, anything capable of making a
  noise, and proceed <i>en masse</i> to the house of the offender, before
  whose door they performed in concert, till their indignation subsided or
  their arms grew weary; and that the noise we then heard was the distant
  sound of such music.</p>

  <p>I do not know if my friend gave any name to this practice; if he did,
  I have since forgotten it. Doubtless, some of your Oxford readers can
  assist me.</p>

  <p class="author">R. V. T.</p>

  <p class="address">Mincing Lane.</p>

  <p>At Marchington, in Staffordshire, the custom exists of having what is
  called a "Rantipole Riding" for every man who beats his wife. The
  ceremony is performed with great care and solemnity. A committee is
  formed to examine into the case. Then the village poet is employed to
  give a history of the occurrence in verse. The procession goes round in
  the evening with a cart, which serves as a stage on which the scene is
  acted and from which the verses are recited. The custom has been there
  observed, with so much judgment and discretion, that it has been
  productive of much good, and has now almost entirely put a stop to this
  disgraceful practice. I can remember several "ridings" in my younger
  days.</p>

  <p class="author">H. B.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Potter</span> will find, upon referring to Vol.

  explanation of it similar to <span class="sc">Mr. Potter's</span> own
  supposition.</p>

  it is used by Wodrow. The <i>branks</i> of the Covenanters was an iron
  collar and chain firmly fixed to a tree, or post, or pillar, about three
  feet from the ground. This was locked round the neck of the luckless
  offender, who was thus obliged to remain in a most inconvenient and
  painful crouching posture, being neither able to stand nor lie. Many of
  these are still to be seen in the neighbourhood of the residences of old
  Highland families who, ere Lord Hardwicke's Jurisdiction Act, exercised
  the powers of pit and gallows. There is one at the entrance to Culloden
  House, near Inverness.</p>

  <p>The SCALE OF PREMIUMS adopted by this Office will be found of a very
  moderate character, but at the same time quite adequate to the risk
  incurred.</p>

  <p>FOUR-FIFTHS, or 80 per cent. of the Profits, are assigned to Policies
  <i>every fifth year</i>, and may be applied to increase the sum insured,
  to an immediate payment in cash, or to the reduction and ultimate
  extinction of future Premiums.</p>

  <p>ONE-THIRD of the Premium on Insurances of 500<i>l.</i> and upwards,
  for the whole term of life, may remain as a debt upon the Policy, to be
  paid off at convenience; or the Directors will lend sums of 50<i>l.</i>
  and upwards, on the security of Policies effected with this Company for
  the whole term of life, when they have acquired an adequate value.</p>

  <p>SECURITY.&mdash;Those who effect Insurances with this Company are

  140,000<i>l.</i> is invested, from the risk incurred by Members of Mutual
